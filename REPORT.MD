# Enhancing Large Language Models with Human Feedback via Reinforcement Learning

## Transformer Architectures: A Detailed Explanation

### Overview of Transformer Models
Transformers, introduced in the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017), have become the foundation of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP). The key innovation lies in the use of the **self-attention mechanism**, which allows the model to weigh the importance of each input token relative to others, enabling it to capture both local and global dependencies in text.

#### Key Components
1. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**:
   - The self-attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of input tokens, where the weights (attention scores) are learned during training.
   - **Multi-head attention** extends this idea by allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously, improving its ability to capture nuanced relationships.

**Mathematical representation**:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

Where \(Q\), \(K\), and \(V\) are the query, key, and value matrices, and \(d_k\) is the dimensionality of the keys.

**Feedforward Layers:**

2. **Feedforward Layers**:
   - Position-wise fully connected layers that apply non-linear transformations to each token's representation independently.

3. **Positional Encoding**:
   - Since Transformers process input tokens in parallel, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to retain the order information.
   - These encodings are often sinusoidal functions of the token position.

### Causal Transformers
Causal Transformers, like GPT and LLAMA, are specialized for autoregressive tasks, where the model predicts the next token in a sequence based on prior tokens. They are trained using a left-to-right masking mechanism to ensure each token only attends to its predecessors.

Key characteristics:
- **Training Objective**: Minimize the negative log-likelihood of the next token:

$\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{t=1}^{T} \log P(x_t \mid x_{<t})$


- **Applications**: Text generation, code completion, and dialogue systems.

## Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

### Conceptual Framework
RLHF bridges the gap between machine-generated outputs and human expectations. It introduces a feedback loop where human preferences guide the model’s behaviour, making it more aligned with desired outcomes.

#### Steps in RLHF:
1. **Training a Reward Model (RM):**
   - Human annotators rank model outputs based on quality or relevance.
   - These rankings are used to train an RM that predicts a scalar reward score for a given output.

2. **Optimizing the Language Model with Reinforcement Learning:**
   - Using the RM as a reward function, the base LLM is fine-tuned with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a policy-gradient RL algorithm.
   - The objective is to maximize the expected reward:

$$
\max_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{x \sim \pi_{\theta}}[R(x)]
$$


#### Challenges
- High computational cost of fine-tuning.
- Balancing fluency and adherence to human preferences.

### Practical Implementation
- Libraries: Hugging Face's [TRL](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) provides utilities for implementing RLHF workflows efficiently.
- Example use case: Fine-tuning GPT-2 to align its responses with specific guidelines.

## Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): A Core Algorithm for RLHF

### Overview
PPO is a robust RL algorithm designed to improve training stability and sample efficiency. It balances exploration and exploitation by constraining the policy updates within a trust region, ensuring that the new policy does not deviate excessively from the old one.

### Key Features
1. **Clipped Objective Function:**
- Limits the change in the probability ratio between the new and old policies:

$$
\mathcal{L}^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[\min\left(r_t(\theta) A_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) A_t\right)\right]
$$

where \(r_t(\theta)\) is the probability ratio and \(A_t\) is the advantage function.

2. **Entropy Regularization:**
   - Encourages policy diversity by penalizing overly deterministic actions.

### Resources
- [CleanRL's PPO Implementation](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/tree/master) provides a minimalistic yet powerful implementation.
- Hugging Face’s [Quickstart Guide](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) for practical insights into PPO with RLHF.

## Applications and Future Directions

### Demonstrated Use Case
In this project, RLHF is applied to fine-tune a GPT-2 model. The fine-tuned model generates text that aligns more closely with human preferences by training a reward model and optimising with PPO.

### Broader Applications
- **Content Moderation:** Aligning models with ethical guidelines.
- **Education:** Personalized tutoring systems.
- **Healthcare:** Generating patient-friendly explanations for medical information.

### Future Work
- Explore cost-efficient alternatives to RLHF, such as hybrid methods combining supervised fine-tuning and lightweight RL.
- Investigate scalability to larger models like GPT-4 or LLAMA 2.
