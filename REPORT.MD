# Enhancing Large Language Models with Human Feedback via Reinforcement Learning

## Transformer Architectures: A Detailed Explanation

### Overview of Transformer Models
Transformers, introduced in the seminal paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017), have become the foundation of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP). The key innovation lies in the use of the **self-attention mechanism**, which allows the model to weigh the importance of each input token relative to others, enabling it to capture both local and global dependencies in text.

#### Key Components
1. **Multi-Head Self-Attention**:
   - The self-attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of input tokens, where the weights (attention scores) are learned during training.
   - **Multi-head attention** extends this idea by allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input simultaneously, improving its ability to capture nuanced relationships.

**Mathematical representation**:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

Where $Q$, $K$, and $V$ are the query, key, and value matrices, and ${d_k}$ is the dimensionality of the keys.

**Feedforward Layers:**

2. **Feedforward Layers**:
   - After the attention step, the output of each token is passed through position-wise fully connected layers. These layers apply non-linear transformations to each token's representation independently, ensuring the model can capture complex relationships.

3. **Positional Encoding**:
   - Since Transformers process input tokens in parallel, they lack the inherent understanding of token order. To address this, positional encodings are added to the input embeddings, typically in the form of sinusoidal functions, ensuring the model retains the sequence order.

### Causal Transformers
Causal Transformers, like GPT and LLAMA, are specialized for autoregressive tasks, where the model predicts the next token in a sequence based on prior tokens. They are trained using a left-to-right masking mechanism to ensure each token only attends to its predecessors.

Key characteristics:
- **Training Objective**: Minimize the negative log-likelihood of the next token:

$\mathcal{L} = -\sum_{t=1}^{T} \log P(x_t \mid x_{t})$


- **Applications**: Causal Transformers are widely used in text generation, code completion, dialogue systems, and any scenario where predicting sequential data is required. For instance, GPT models are frequently used in chatbots and automated content creation.

## Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)

### Conceptual Framework
Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) helps bridge the gap between machine-generated outputs and human expectations. In RLHF, human annotators provide feedback on the quality of generated outputs, which guides the model's behaviour to better align with human preferences. This feedback loop refines the model to make its responses more relevant and appropriate.

#### Steps in RLHF:
1. **Training a Reward Model (RM):**
- Human evaluators rank the model's outputs based on criteria such as relevance, coherence, and alignment with human expectations. These rankings are then used to train a Reward Model (RM), which predicts a scalar reward score for each output.

2. **Optimizing the Language Model with Reinforcement Learning:**
- The base Large Language Model (LLM) is fine-tuned using Reinforcement Learning (RL), specifically with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this process, the RM is used as a reward function, guiding the LLM to maximize the expected reward. The goal is to align the model's responses more closely with human preferences.
-The objective function for RLHF is:

<p align="center">
  <b>max</b><sub>&#x3B8;</sub> <i>E</i><sub>x &#8764; &#x3C0;<sub>&#x3B8;</sub></sub>[R(x)]
</p>

Where:
- $\pi_\theta$ is the **policy** (the model),
- $R(x)$ is the **reward** for a given output $x$,
- $\theta$ is the set of model parameters.

#### Challenges
- Computational Cost: Fine-tuning models with human feedback can be computationally expensive, requiring significant resources and time to train.
- Balancing Fluency and Adherence to Human Preferences: One of the key challenges in RLHF is ensuring that the model remains fluent and coherent while strictly adhering to human feedback. There is often a trade-off between these two aspects.

### Practical Implementation
- Libraries: Hugging Face's [TRL](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) provides utilities for implementing RLHF workflows efficiently.
- Example use case: Fine-tuning GPT-2 on a specific task, such as generating responses aligned with certain ethical guidelines, involves:

1. Collecting human feedback through rankings or preferences.
2. Training a reward model to predict the quality of responses based on this feedback.
3. Fine-tuning the GPT-2 model using PPO with the reward model as the guiding signal.

## Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO): A Core Algorithm for RLHF

### Overview
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is one of the most widely used reinforcement learning algorithms for fine-tuning models with human feedback. PPO strikes a balance between exploration and exploitation by ensuring that policy updates are not too drastic, preventing instability in training.

### Key Features
1. **Clipped Objective Function:**
- PPO’s objective function is designed to limit the change in the probability ratio between the new and old policies, ensuring stable updates:

$$
\mathcal{L}^{\text{CLIP}}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}\left[\min\left(r_t(\theta) A_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) A_t\right)\right]
$$

where $r_t(\theta)$ is the probability ratio and $A_t$ is the advantage function.

2. **Entropy Regularization:**
- To encourage the policy to explore diverse actions, PPO includes entropy regularization. This discourages overly deterministic policies, promoting a more diverse set of responses from the model.

### Resources
- [CleanRL's PPO Implementation](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/tree/master) provides a minimalistic yet powerful implementation.
- Hugging Face’s [Quickstart Guide](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf) for practical insights into PPO with RLHF.

## Applications and Future Directions

### Demonstrated Use Case
In this project, RLHF is applied to fine-tune a GPT-2 model. The fine-tuned model generates text that aligns more closely with human preferences by training a reward model and optimising with PPO.

### Broader Applications
- **Content Moderation:** Aligning models with ethical and safety guidelines to filter harmful or inappropriate content.
- **Education:** Developing personalized tutoring systems that can adapt to individual student needs by adjusting the model's behavior based on feedback.
- **Healthcare:** Using RLHF to generate patient-friendly explanations of medical information, ensuring both clarity and accuracy.

### Future Work
- **Cost-efficient Alternatives to RLHF:** Future research could explore hybrid methods that combine supervised fine-tuning and lighter RL techniques to reduce the computational burden of RLHF.
- **Scaling to Larger Models:** Investigating the application of RLHF on models like GPT-4 or LLAMA 2, exploring scalability and efficiency in fine-tuning large-scale models.
