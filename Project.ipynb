        "\n",
        "   The processing speed decreases after applying the filter, as expected, since the model is now working with cleaner and more refined data. This highlights an additional step in data preparation.\n",

        "#### **2. Training Loss:**\n",
        "   - At **step 50**, the training loss is **0.7056**.\n",
        "   - By **step 100**, it slightly decreases to **0.6905**.\n",

        "   - The validation loss remains **constant at 0.6931** throughout training, which indicates the model is **not generalizing well** to unseen data. This flat behavior may suggest overfitting or underfitting. The model is struggling to improve on the validation set, potentially due to:\n",

        "   A loss value of **0.6931** is characteristic of cross-entropy loss when class probabilities are close to 0.5 (log(2)). This indicates the model struggles to differentiate between classes. Potential causes include class imbalance, overfitting, or insufficient training.\n",

        "- **Data Issues**: Verify that the data pipeline ensures proper shuffling and diversity in training samples.  \n",

        "#### **2. Improving Generalization:**\n",
        "The flat validation loss and fluctuating accuracy indicate overfitting or underfitting. Possible remedies include:\n",
        "- **Regularization**: Techniques like dropout, batch normalization, or early stopping.  \n",
        "- **Data Augmentation**: Expand the dataset with variations to improve robustness.  \n",
